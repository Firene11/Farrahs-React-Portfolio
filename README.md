# Farrah's React Portfolio

[Check it out! Visit my deployed page here!](https://farrahs-react-portfolio-cea01012d0e5.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

My personal portfolio is a single-page application built with React. When you load my portfolio for the first time- you are presented with a page containing a navigation bar, header, a section for content which loads my **About Me** section by default, and a footer. Here you can view my profile photo and short bio.

## Usage

When you view my navigation titles, you are presented with the titles **About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume**.

When you click on a navigation title, you are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading.

When you are presented with the **Portfolio** section, you see titled images of six of my applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository.

When you are presented with the **Contact** section, you see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When you move your cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, you receive a notification that this field is required. When you enter text into the email address field, you receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.

When you are presented with the **Resume** section, you see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of my proficiencies.

When you view the footer, you are presented with icon links to my Email, GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. **( I omitted the third party media link because I want to keep those private, !important)**
